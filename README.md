### Use BERT with PyTorch
- By far my favorite along the 3/4 sources that I had a look at: [BERT Fine-Tuning Tutorial with PyTorch for Text Classification on The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (COLA) Dataset.](https://medium.com/@aniruddha.choudhury94/part-2-bert-fine-tuning-tutorial-with-pytorch-for-text-classification-on-the-corpus-of-linguistic-18057ce330e1)
- More straight to the point : [Fine-Tuning BERT model using PyTorch](https://medium.com/@prakashakshay/fine-tuning-bert-model-using-pytorch-f34148d58a37)
### Use BERT for a specific task (regression is quite a rare task in NLP - classification being much more used)
- A great bucket of code is provided in the comments [Fine-Tuning BERT for a regression task](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/e8kyc3/finetuning_bert_for_a_regression_task/)
### A guys talking about what he did for this codalab competition
- Not amazing but interesting though : [Assessing the Funniness of Edited News Headlines](https://medium.com/@cselig/assessing-the-funniness-of-edited-news-headlines-3ec03056f29a)
